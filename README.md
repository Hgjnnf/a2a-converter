# a2a-converter
Make any agents A2A compatible with ease

## Ideal user flow:
1. Command Line to generate a settings yaml file
2. Fill out the pre-generated .yaml for AgentCard + Other settings
3. Command line to complete the conversion
4. (Optional) Command line to deploy 

## Backlog:
- Defining url for deployed agents (challenge: how will we know what the public url is)
